1- Main app is app.py. When you run the app, it creates a databank and a table in it that shows city name, description and temperature of the weather. It uses OWM(OpenWeatherMap) website and uses an API key defined in .env file to access the current data info.

2- Again the configurations such as city name can be changed in config.json file.

3- The weatherfetcher.py is the main program that executes creating a databank and table name but also scraping data from OWM API.
